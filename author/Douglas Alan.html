            <article>
                <p>The purpose of this document is to explain something about how the Chip File
Writer works. The Chip File Writer uses the &quot;Stream&quot; data type that comes with
Scala as part of the standard library. Streams are a staple of functional
programming. They were invented for the Scheme programming language, and then
adopted and used heavily by Haskell. In fact, they are used so heavily in
Haskell that <em>all</em> Lists in Haskell are really Streams.</p>
<p>Streams offer a number of advantages for certain kinds of programming tasks,
but due to differences between Scala and Scheme or Haskell, and for reasons
that we will get into, in order to avoid exhausting the heap, more care has to
be taken when using Streams in Scala than you would have to in either Scheme or
Haskell.</p>
